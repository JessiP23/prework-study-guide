#Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description
 My motivation was to help students keep their notes from what we learned in the Prework. It contains notes on JavaScript, CSS, HMTL, and GitHub.

## Instalation

## Usage
 If we open DevTools console, we can see the JavaScript running. There are notes in certain topic, like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git. For sugggestions on what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics we learned from the prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.
