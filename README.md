# <Your-Project-Title>
 Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description
 My motivation was to help students keep their notes from what we learned in the pre-work. It contains notes on JavaScript, CSS, HMTL, and GitHub.

## Instalation 
 N/A

## Usage
 If we open the DevTools console, we can see the JavaScript running. There are notes on certain topics, like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. For suggestions on what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics we learned from the prework and a suggestion on which topic to study first.
